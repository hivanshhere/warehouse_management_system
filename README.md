# warehouse_management_system


RapidRack: Fast, Smart, and Scalable Warehouse System is a Java-based project designed to simplify and optimize storage and retrieval operations in a warehouse. It uses smart pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and A* (A-Star) Algorithm to find the shortest and most efficient routes within the warehouse for picking or storing items.
For faster organization, the system uses QuickSort to sort items by priority or category. Behind the scenes, it uses important Data Structures such as HashMaps, Queues, and Stacks to manage inventory data efficiently.
A clean and easy-to-use JavaFX GUI has been developed to allow both admins and staff to interact with the system without technical difficulty.
The goal of this project is to simulate how a real warehouse functions and provide an intelligent system that saves time, improves accuracy, and reduces manual work.
